# Post

This is the main content that's posted to the site - I want it to be deeper than what Reddit provides.

It has to look *really* sharp. Very unlike Reddit's posts.

* [[post-title|title]]
* [[post-description|description]]
* [[post-summary|summary]]
* [[post-comment-count|comment count]]
* [[post-posted-date|posted iso date]]
* [[post-published-date|published iso date]]
* [[post-votes|votes]]
* [[post-tags|tags]]
* [[post-image|image]]

A post can be a [[post-type|specific type]]

A post can contain [[comment|comments]]

#requirement all dates must be ISO 8601. No discussion.
